              <h3>
                We are passionate about developing websites and web apps that
                communicate to the world what makes you unique.

              <hr />
              <p>
                GoLive WebDev is run by a mother &amp; son team, Michele and
                Anthony, both with unique skills. Michele started learning how to
                build web pages as a personal hobby. Through that, she found her
                employer needed that type of skill along with marketing skills to
                start email marketing campaigns.
              </p>
              <p>
                Anthony took an interest in coding by watching his mom work. She
                encouraged his interest by buying him a computer at a very young
                age. She taught him some very basic html and signed him up for
                some computer courses for very young children. He took that
                interest and actively looked for more languages to learn.
              </p>
              <p>
                Now, they actively share their passion for coding together, having
                long discussions about the many different technologies used to
                make modern websites.
              </p>
              <p>
                That being said, when they found they were in need of a product or
                service, the first place they would look would be online. It
                amazed them both how many businesses had no online presense or a
                poorly created website.
              </p>
              <p>
                Thus the creation of GoLive WebDev, a company focused on helping
                organizations brand themselves with a unique website so they can
                be found by their future customers.

            <h4>Co-Founder of GoLive WebDev</h4>
            <p>
              I enjoy developing user friendly interatcive websites and apps that
              define an organization or individual. It's my belief that every
              website should be unique and tell a story visually and through
              content.
            </p>
            <p>
              I have a background in online marketing and business development.
              It's my marketing experience that taught me that a website isn't
              enough, you need to have a have a sight that has a call to action.
              It's important to keep people's attention and to be very clear on
              what you want a customer to do while on your site or app.
            </p>
            <p>
              After coding simple websites and email templates, I chose to attend
              the University of Pennsylvania Coding Bootcamp, graduating in the
              top of my class.
            </p>
            <p>
              On a more personal note, my first passion is my family and I love to
              spend time outdoors riding horses, gardening, kayaking and hiking.
