            <h2>Finding Your Business</h2>
            <p>
              There are two vastly underrated things to consider when having an
              online presence: your domain name and advertisements. By using
              both of these to their fullest potential, you will see an increase
              in leads and an increase in customers.
            </p>
            <h3 id="url">Domain Names</h3>
            <p>
              The base of a good website is a good domain name. A domain name is
              a website's URL, which is used to navigate to your website. The
              best domains are those that are short but convey the business or
              product.
            </p>
            <p>
              You want to make sure that your domain name isn't too long, or
              people won't remember it and your website will be negatively
              ranked for having too long of a domain.
            </p>
            <p>
              We are always happy to help you get the best domain for your
              business, and will make sure that you get something you are happy
              with. <a href="/contact.html">Contact us</a> to learn more about

            </h3>
            <p>
              Getting your business to the top of Google's search results is no
              easy task, but one major way to help it is via Google
              Advertisements.
            </p>
            <p>
              When you look for something on Google, the first results that show
              up are the ones that paid to be there. We will set up
              pay-per-click advertisements for your business. This means you
              only have to pay for advertisements that potential clients are
              actively clicking on.
