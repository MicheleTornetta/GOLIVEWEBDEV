## What is an XSS attack?

A critical security vulnerability that could affect any website with user-generated content.

## Cross-Side Scripting

This attack is focused on the users of your website. The attacker may hijack a user's session, capture keystrokes, steal critical user information and more.

If you have any type of input field, from a comments box to a search bar, there is the potential for an attacker can insert code on the client side that will allow them to gain illegal access to any user's data. For instance, an attacker could steal the user's login information by grabbing a legitimate user's cookies, tokens and other information stored by the browser. They could also send the user to a fake url and store their information on a server.

Once the attacker has this information, they can easily log into a customer's account and steal their credit card information, address and any information that should be private to the victim. The cybercriminal will frequently take over the victim's account by changing their password and other login details.

A victim's browser doesn't have a way to recognize malicious scripts, and it's very unlikely the user will notice an illigitamate script being run. Even if they did notice something is wrong with the website, it's too late, the damage has already been done.

## Protecting Your Users

The best method is prevention. Every time a user's input is taken it should be sanitized by the server and client. In addition, the user input should always be sanitized when it is displayed by both the server and the client. This form of redundancy guarantees even if it's forgotten in one place it's covered by another. When it comes to security double, and even triple checking, is always a must.

While prevention is always the best method, mitigation methods should be in place in the event of human error and areas of high security importance.

One example of this would be to confirm that the login session token matches your customer's IP address. If it doesn't, your website should require that they log in again to ensure it is actually them. This way, even if a malicious actor gets someone's login token, they still cannot login to the victim's account.

### The Bottom Line

This is just one of many vulnerabilities that could compromise your website. However your website is constructed, make sure that you take the steps necessary to secure it. If you are unsure about the security of your website, the worst thing you can do is ignore it. When security is ignored, you will eventually have an incident like [this](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/british-airways-data-theft-demonstrates-need-for-cross-site-scripting-restrictions/), [this](https://infra.apache.org/blog/apache_org_04_09_2010) or [this](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2010/sep/21/twitter-hack-explained-xss-javascript).
