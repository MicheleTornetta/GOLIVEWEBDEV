## How Can You Keep Up with Consumer Behavior?

In today's market, you need to have a website to reach the modern consumer.

Showcasing your business online is no longer an additional way to market your business, it's the primary way to attract customers. After all, the most popular way to find a business is through search engines such as Google. Almost half of all consumers use this method. Are you comfortable with half of your potential clients never finding you?

It's necessary to meet your customers where they are. Advertising in the local newspaper was fine 20 years ago, but today, with readership going down each year, it doesn't do much to attract new business.

Today's consumers turn more and more to their phones to search for products and services. If you have no web app or mobile friendly website, they aren't going to find you.

Think about the last time you needed a product or service. If you're like me, the first place you'd go is Google. Even when someone recommends a business, I still look up the company's website to get to know that business.

Having a poorly made website could do more damage than good. When I find a website is unusable on a phone, I am immediately turned off and start searching elsewhere. I am not unique in this practice. Most customers, when given a poor experience on a website, will view your business just as poorly.

### The Bottom Line

You need a website, but not just any website. You need a good-looking, functional, and accessible website to give your customers a great first impression.
