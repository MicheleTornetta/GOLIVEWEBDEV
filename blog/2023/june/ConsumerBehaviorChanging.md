Showcasing your business online is no longer an additional way to market your business, it's the primary way to attract customers.  After all the most popular way to find a business is through search engines.  Almost half of all consumers use this method; with the second most popular way people choose a business is through television advertisements.  Let's face it, TV ads are expensive!  

It's necessary to meet your customers where they are.  It goes without saying, unless you have a previous relationship with a customer, you are not going to be the business that comes to mind when they have a need.

Advertising in the local newspaper was fine wever years ago, but today, it doesn't do much to attract new business since readership goes down year after year.

Today's consumers turn more and more to their phone to search for products and services.  If you have no web app or mobile friendly website, they aren't going to find you or in the the case of a site that isn't mobile friendly, stick around long enough to find out how you can solve their need.

Think about the last time you needed a product or service.  If you're like me, the first place I go is google.  Even when someone recommends a business, I still look up the companie's website to get to know that business.  

Of course, having a static website isn't enough, it needs to be mobile friendly.  While people certainly use desktops and laptops, the majority of customers use their cell phone to search.  So, your website or web app needs to be attractive, mobile friendly with easy navigation so that anyone can find what they're looking for.
